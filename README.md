# Project_3

### Tools
We created this Web dashboard using HTML with CSS, Python with pandas and Matplotlib


### Objective: 
The objective of this project is to create a compelling data visualization that tells a story about what factors contribute to happiness in different countries. I will be using the World Happiness dataset from Kaggle, which includes data on factors like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.
